## Being a good githubber guide

- Work on personal stuff relating to the project in your own folder
- Use the Python Black extension so we have consistent formatting

- Variable naming
  - CamelCase for classes
  - camelCase for functions
  - snake_case for variables
  - ALL_CAPS for constants
  - Use descriptive variable names for code readability
